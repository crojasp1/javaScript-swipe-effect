# javaScript-swipe-effect
In this proyect I will learn and show how to do some "Tinder" app effects as swipe. The idea is to do almost the same functionality but adapted to a new proyect I would like to create. This is gonna be one of a lot of proyects I would like to try just to practice and find the best way to do my app.
